Handling Git Merge Conflicts
Introduction
This document describes a merge conflict scenario encountered during the development of a new feature and the steps taken to resolve it. The conflict occurred in the new-feature.md file, which was modified in two different branches.

Steps to Create a Conflict
Modify new-feature.md in the feature-update branch:

In the feature-update branch, the following content was added to new-feature.md:

markdown
Copy code
## New Feature: Streaming, Save, and Download

This feature allows users to stream content online, save it for later, and download it for offline viewing.
Modify new-feature.md in the main branch:

Meanwhile, in the main branch, a different change was made to the same file:

markdown
Copy code
## Upcoming Feature: Media Options

We are working on providing options for online streaming, saving content for later, and downloading.
Commit both changes:

Changes in the feature-update branch were committed with the message: "Added new feature description".
Changes in the main branch were committed with the message: "Updated upcoming features section".
Create a Conflict:

When attempting to merge the feature-update branch into the main branch, a conflict occurred because both branches modified the same section of new-feature.md.

The Conflict
During the merge attempt, Git identified conflicting changes in new-feature.md and marked the file with conflict markers:

plaintext
Copy code
<<<<<<< HEAD
## Upcoming Feature: Media Options

We are working on providing options for online streaming, saving content for later, and downloading.
=======
## New Feature: Streaming, Save, and Download

This feature allows users to stream content online, save it for later, and download it for offline viewing.
>>>>>>> feature-update
Resolving the Conflict
To resolve the conflict, the following steps were taken:

Open new-feature.md in a text editor.

Manually merge the changes:

The final merged content incorporated elements from both conflicting changes:

markdown
Copy code
## New Feature: Streaming, Save, and Download

We are excited to announce a new feature that allows users to stream content online, save it for later viewing, and download it for offline access. This feature combines the flexibility of online streaming with the convenience of offline viewing.
Stage the resolved file:

sh
Copy code
git add new-feature.md
Commit the resolution:

sh
Copy code
git commit -m "Resolved conflict in new-feature.md by merging feature descriptions"
Complete the merge:

Switch back to the main branch and merge the changes:

sh
Copy code
git checkout main
git merge feature-update
Conclusion
The conflict in new-feature.md was successfully resolved by manually merging the changes from both branches. The resolved file now accurately reflects the enhancements and upcoming features related to online streaming, saving content, and downloading options.

By documenting the conflict and resolution process, we ensure that similar conflicts can be handled efficiently in the future. This experience also highlights the importance of clear communication and collaboration among team members to avoid conflicting changes.
